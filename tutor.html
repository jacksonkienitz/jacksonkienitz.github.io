                    <br>
                    My most valuable lesson in undergrad, and so too in grad-school, was a very simple, <i>Jeez, there’s so much more to learn.</i> The most valuable tool my teachers offered was the confidence to learn on my own.
                    <br><br>
                    My hope as a tutor is to fan the flame of each student’s curiosity, and guide my students to a place where they can take initiative in their own learning.
                    <br><br>
                    If a student is interested in computer science, we might read articles on A.I. alignment and discuss its philosophical implications, or read the speculative fiction of authors like Ursula Le Guin to inspire their ideas of the future.
                    <br><br>
                    If a student is interested in comedy, we can analyze clown Jacque Tati who says, “Comedy begins in the legs” (in other words, laugh as Jacque falls down).
                    <br><br>
                    If a student needs help with homework, we will embrace the <i>I don’t know!</i> and look it up together. To feel secure in not knowing and trust that knowing will come.
                    <br><br>
                    I grew up with a mixed-bag of interests: animation and 3D modeling, theatre and sketch comedy, soccer and agriculture. I’m forever thankful to those mentors along the way who encouraged me to keep adding to the rucksack…<i>One day that’ll come in handy!</i>
                    <br><br><br>
                    EDUCATION & EXPERIENCE
                    <br>
                    I graduated <i>Magna cum laude</i> from Columbia University, with a double-major in Creative Writing and Dramatic Arts. My postgraduate studies were completed at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, where I earned an M.F.A in Acting Classical/Contemporary Text, and received the Saltire Scholarship awarded for merit by the Scottish Government.
                    <br><br>
                    I’ve written 100+ pages of literary analysis and study material for GradeSaver, one of the major providers of academic study guides, and have significant experience working with students at the Palo Alto Children’s Theatre and Palo Alto Foothills Summer Camps.
