      What we, and we here being Yahweh, don’t like<br>
Is the question.<br>
<br>
And I am really conscious of everything I say.<br>
<br>
Just a quick quick caveat about what I’m able to do:<br>
<br>
Big scale sort of nature.<br>
The um big uh sublime nature.<br>
<br>
Instead of being like you know,<br>
Let me think of a good example.<br>
<br>
Like you know instead of <br>
Instead of having a setting of<br>
A giant mountain like in the background,<br>
I can make a grassy plateau.<br>
<br>
What I can’t do is I can’t hear everyone at once.<br>
<br>
Why is the finger sized for fitting<br>
in the nostril? An example of the question.<br>
<br>
All it is is you decree that that that was going to happen was going to happen.<br>
<br>
What constitutes work time what constitutes<br>
leisure time? That’s the other question.<br>
<br>
Canine melodramas.<br>
Equestrian melodramas.<br>
Nautical melodramas.<br>
<br>
All leisure time.<br>
<br>
Don’t know about you folks<br>
but I don’t remember floating in the ether<br>
and choosing to inhabit this enigmatic bodily form.<br>
<br>
I hear that often.<br>
<br>
And I think the thing is it gets a little<br>
sometimes fuzzy for people but that’s okay.<br>
<br>
You have people who are good you have people who are bad.<br>
You have conflict based in really broad strokes.<br>
<br>
I encourage everyone to take what one might call a gestalt shift.<br>
Undertake that gestalt shift<br>
and try to uh inhabit your own world.<br>

&emsp;A giant squid / harpooned / floating towards the break<br>
higher still / among the clouds / while the mountaineer<br>
climbing / unharnessed / the boulders of a flooded river bed<br>
loses his grip… <br>
<br>
&emsp;…lambent / along the black current / light from another sunrise<br>
through the shutters of our dining room window / gleams<br>
in my daughter’s tea / like in her irises / brown <br>
like her mother’s / when / studying in the garden <br>
I learn her face in profile...<br>
<br>
&emsp;In the stillness of memory / a red cedar grows around me.<br>

&emsp;I am indebted to the woodpecker / who offers<br>
another pinhole / through which my eye may look.<br>

  <summary>FRAGMENTS FROM AN ESSAY ON SILENCE</summary>
  &emsp;&emsp;<i>by Jackson Kienitz</i><br>
  <br>
<i>AUTHOR’S NOTE: In this piece, I am attempting to blend the rhetoric expected of an <br>
argumentative essay, with a more poetic form—my hope is that a poetic form <br>
will force space between my own arguments, allowing readers to find their own.</i><br>
<br>
the forest approaches<br>
 Macbeth would rather condemn all, than condemn one—namely, himself:<br>
“Life’s but a—<br>
<br>
<br>
	full of sound and fury,<br>
signifying nothing” (Shakespeare, Macbeth).<br>
<br>
and Spongebob Squarepants awards Patrick Starr a trophy. Engraved on the plaque:<br>
“For Doing Absolutely Nothing Longer Than Anybody Else”<br>
						(SpongeBob, “Something Smells”).<br>
[…]<br>
<br>
the paradoxical nature of nothing, of negative definitions:&emsp;		the absence of sound,<br>
darkness as the absence of light, evil as the…&emsp;  		absence of one relies on presence of<br>
 the other
<br>
John Cage says in&emsp; 	“Lecture on Nothing,”<br>
“but what silence requires&emsp;						is&emsp;					<br>
that I go on talking” (Cage, “Lecture on Nothing”).<br>
<br>
Silence exists because sound exists,&emsp; 		dangling on either edge<br>
Or, no, rather—sound exists because silence exists&emsp;		open hands to catch the sound!<br>
The two are twins wrestling &emsp;	 	neither born first: silence is the orphan of sound<br>
simultaneously, the parent of sound.<br>
<br>
seeking a definition of theatre, director Peter Brooks distills	 theatre <br>
into a comparable positive/negative relationship: “I can take any empty space <br>
and call it a bare stage. A man walks across this empty space whilst someone else <br>
is watching him, and this is all that is needed for an act of theatre to be engaged.”
The same might be said of<br>
I can take any silence and call it a hushed theatre. A woman speaks through this silence<br>
 whilst someone else is listening to her, and this is all that is needed <br>
 for an act of theatre to<br>
<br>
Words, words, words.&emsp; 			going much further along this path of definitions <br>
would be to<br>
lose ourselves in the rules of grammar—and life, from my understanding, is<br>
 not exactly grammatical
<br>
&emsp;          in a lecture, or watching a performance, when the speaker’s word-after-word turns<br>
alphabet soup, when my mind begins to stack soup cans into a pyramid,<br>
thoughts flickering beside the supermarket’s fluorescents—<br>
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;perhaps you’re there now—<br>
<br>
what most regularly returns me to the lecture hall,&emsp;		 reminds me that my mind<br>
 has wandered:<br>
the sound of silence.<br>
<br>
Is it my turn to speak?<br>
What’s happening?<br>
<br>
Is&emsp;&emsp;	 what?<br>
<br>
<br>
Say something! Anyone!<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Please!<br>
<br>
	I think someone missed an entrance.<br>
<br>
The major fears of performance often end in silence: the line that is forgotten, the cue <br>
that is missed, the joke that rouses no laughter…<br>
<br>
Silence speaks in Uncertainty.<br>
<br>
It is Anton Chekhov’s mother-tongue: he knows, and shows, in his characters,<br>
&emsp;the natural fear (or: power over mind)<br>
&emsp;of silence, and the uncertainty silence carries<br>
<br>
Consider the doctor, Astrov, of Uncle Vanya:<br>
returning daily, for months, to visit the Serebryakov estate,<br>
in hopes of a hopeless affair with Serebryakov’s wife, Elena…<br>
<br>
By play’s end, Elena and her husband leave the estate—permanently—<br>
and Astrov, struggling to accept this failed romance, idles behind,<br>
&emsp;postponing his own departure<br>
<br>
Astrov strives against silence—against the failed past/uncertain future it signifies—<br>
through inane small talk:<br>
“My trace horse has gone lame for some reason,” he says,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;to which no one responds<br>
“Out there in Africa now, I expect the heat must be terrific!” he tries again...<br>
&emsp;(Chekhov, Uncle Vanya)<br>
<br>
Silence for Astrov (and so, too, an audience, if used skillfully) seems a small, quiet death,<br>
	the sleep at the end of Astrov’s day of love—<br>
&emsp;&emsp;will night bring Sugar-Plum Fairies?<br>
	Or...<br>
<br>
“Aye! There’s the rub: for in that sleep of death, what dreams may come, when we <br>
have shuffled off this mortal coil, must give us pause…”	&emsp;&emsp;		(Shakespeare, Hamlet)<br>
<br>
Smack in the middle of Hamlet’s most iconic soliloquy<br>
precisely at the point of epiphany—the moment Hamlet realizes the “what” <br>
that follows death, could, in fact, be worse than life itself (just as Astrov fears!)—<br>
<br>
Shakespeare, 	 through form and content, forces&emsp; 	silence.<br>
<br>
He directly instructs us to “give pause,”&emsp;		ends the clause, with <br>
a hard-stopped period, half-way through the line—“must give us pause. There’s the respect”— <br>
 driving the text to a screeching halt.<br>
<br>
unlike the surrounding lines, here Shakespeare breaks from his established iambic pentameter;<br>
must-give-us-pause, there’s-the-re-spect:<br>
&emsp;only eight syllables.<br>
<br>
When reading the line aloud, almost instinctively, an actor will look for<br>
a two-syllable rest,&emsp; 	so as to maintain rhythmic symmetry.<br>
<br>
In fact, I encourage you to perform Hamlet’s soliloquy without pausing<br>
after the word “pause.”	&emsp;&emsp;	I do this to annoy my parents,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;who cringe at my bastardization of the Bard...<br>
<br>
Within this moment of silence, Shakespeare offers Hamlet—and, too, the audience—<br>
 space to breathe in the emotional significance of the “To be, or not to be” speech.<br>
Maybe, space to sigh, perchance to cry...<br>
<br>
And, a more practical note,&emsp;&emsp;		a pause makes for easier<br>
audience comprehension. &emsp;&emsp;		In a classroom, when some seventh graders are reading aloud,<br>
 say, Romeo and Juliet,	 one of the easiest ways a student can improve her reading<br>
  is to embrace the pauses, letting each thought impress before starting the next—rather than<br>
   a recitation of one’s multiplication tables...		 the text becomes emotive poetry…
<br>
giving audiences the space to reflect on what has happened<br>
 and guess at what may follow<br>
<br>
Director Robert Wilson, noted for his use of stillness, puts it simply: “It [silence] <br>
lets me think” (“Robert Wilson and Willem Dafoe”).<br>
<br>
Bilingual Silence: conversational fluency in Reflection and Forethought<br>
<br>
Precisely Hamlet’s focus<br>
“To be, or not to be—”<br>
A speech of reflection and forethought<br>
<br>
But is not Hamlet’s speech, also, a question of positives and negatives?<br>
To live, or to die. To act, or to not act. To speak, or to remain silent!<br>
<br>
Hamlet is asking questions not unlike those that guide this very— 	!<br>
<br>
And what is Hamlet’s discovery, the “rub,” in his— 	? He realizes that the negative— <br>
death, sleep—might actually be a positive: “For in that sleep of death what dreams may come.”<br>
<br>
Shakespeare is suggesting that negatives can hold positives—that death, or sleep, or... <br>
might actually hold life, and dreams, and—		!<br>
<br>
meaning! 	found in the cracks between a traditional understanding of meaning!<br>
<br>
It is the search that drives Samuel Beckett, and other writers working in absurdism:<br>
	making the meaningless meaningful.<br>
<br>
Beckett makes his speech impotent as a medium of communication:<br>
	Lucky, the slave in Waiting for Godot, when commanded to “Think, pig!”,<br>
in a nonsensical soliloquy declares:<br>
“Given the existence as uttered forth in the public works of Puncher and<br>
Wattmann of a personal God quaquaquaqua with white beard<br>
quaquaquaqua…” (Beckett, Waiting for Godot)<br>
<br>
Speech fails, too, in Krapp’s Last Tape,<br>
story of an aging man, interacting with his own memories through a recorded audio-diary:<br>
<br>
<br>
the majority of the play’s dialogue is fragmented story—memories recounted by the<br>
 tape-recording, lacking context,<br>
and so, stripped of meaning<br>
<br>
Instead, meaning is found in the quiet relationship the old Krapp forms with each recording<br>
<br>
After one recording mentions a former lover, Krapp rewinds the tape<br>
Beckett’s stage-direction reads: “Krapp’s lips move. No sound.”  (Beckett, Krapp’s Last Tape)<br>
<br>
Beckett chooses to communicate emotional significance<br>
through a silent tremble of the lip<br>
<br>
	and the show ends with Krapp motionless, a “the tape runs on in silence”<br>
		has Krapp’s life come to an end?<br>
<br>
Beckett is not moving away from meaning, but rather returning to a lack of meaning:<br>
	for an absurdist sees—through the limits of our human understanding—that all meaning,<br>
thus far, has its foundations built on a lack of meaning<br>
<br>
We find our own purposes, set our own rules, create our own Gods<br>
something can’t come from nothing—and yet we do it everyday<br>
<br>
Absurdism is not a condemnation of meaning, but a celebration<br>
of our ability to find meaning in a forest that appears to lack meaning!<br>
<br>
And if silence can speak as loudly as speech itself,<br>
	then Silence speaks in Power<br>
<br>
at a Black Lives Matter protest, today, we hear: Silence is Violence<br>
earlier&emsp;		during Vietnam anti-war protests, a 1967 executive statement <br>
from the Clergy & Laymen Concerned About Vietnam, cited by Martin Luther King Jr., declares:<br>
 “A time comes when silence is betrayal” (King Jr., “Beyond Vietnam”).<br>
<br>
		again: Silence speaks in Power (Oppression, when corrupted)<br>
<br>
It must be of note that Suzan-Lori Parks—<br>
one of the foremost contemporary playwrights,<br>
whose writing centers upon the narratives of black lives and historically voiceless peoples—<br>
associates silence with authenticity of self.<br>
<br>
	Parks, of her scripted silences, writes:&emsp;&emsp; 	“a spell:<br>
&emsp;&emsp;An elongated and heightened (rest) […]<br>
&emsp;&emsp;This is a place where the figures experience their <br>
&emsp;&emsp;pure true simple state.” (Parks, “Elements of Style”).<br>
<br>
	The brothers of Parks’ Topdog/Underdog express a similar sentiment:<br>
&emsp;&emsp;“ BOOTH&emsp; 	Whatd he say, that one time? ‘Yr only yrself––’<br>
&emsp;&emsp;   LINCOLN&emsp;	‘—when no ones watching,’ yeah.” (Parks, Topdog/Underdog)<br>
<br>
When external forces demand subjugation and/or conformity,<br>
to not act, to not speak—these choices can become subversive actions.<br>
<br>
Take Suzan-Lori Parks’ play, Venus:<br>
her protagonist is Saartjie Baartman—a woman from South Africa,<br>
coerced, later forced, into exhibition within a European, travelling “Freak Show.”<br>
<br>
The ring-leader demands of Baartman: “Sound the drum […] Sing!” (Parks, Venus)<br>
later, a European doctor hopes to “civilize” Baartman by teaching her French,<br>
by changing her speech<br>
<br>
		To not sing, to not speak French…<br>
		silence, if not an act of rebellion, is at least a space of respite for Baartman<br>
<br>
Perhaps this is why Parks writes “Scene 19: A Scene of Love (?)”:<br>
a scene composed entirely of one silent “spell”—no dialogue, no stage-directions—<br>
 framed as an emotional swell in Baartman’s narrative.<br>
<br>
A woman whose single comfort (or last resort) is silence<br>
a painful reality, repeated...<br>
<br>
	see: Hermia and Helena,<br>
	who, in the entirety of Midsummer’s final act,<br>
&emsp;after each woman has married,<br>
Shakespeare refuses to give a single line of dialogue.<br>
<br>
To appreciate Parks’ use of silence, is not to enjoy Baartman’s need for silence:<br>
<br>
as poet/social-theorist Audre Lord’s daughter tells her:<br>
“you're never really a whole person if you remain silent,<br>
because there's always that one little piece inside you that wants<br>
to be spoken out…” (Lord, “Silence into Action”)<br>
<br>
Knowing my place,<br>
fortune of the birth-lottery,<br>
I must encourage others to be loud—<br>
if only Baartman had the freedom to be loud, and truthfully loud!—<br>
but to do so, must I also quiet myself?<br>
<br>
It is with great humility and trust that Suzan-Lori Parks writes a silent scene into Venus.<br>
&emsp;	and how deeply exciting, too: she gives each director,<br>
each actress, in each portrayal of Saartjie Baartman,<br>
complete freedom to speak a new interpretation, and<br>
find her own meaning.<br>
<br>
Isn’t the search for meaning one of our favorite past-times?<br>
<br>
[…]<br>
<br>
In hospice, my grandmother&emsp;&emsp;		80-years-old, 92-lbs<br>
pulse of 3 BPM<br>
<br>
hasn’t opened her eyes for a half-dozen days<br>
<br>
	So when she, in her final breath, sits up and looks my mother straight in the eye––<br>
<br>
a single flash of silent something<br>
with which my mother can find peace––<br>
<br>
please don’t tell mom that “the frog legs dance because<br>
positively-charged-sodium-ions-replicate-the-natural-processes-of-a-neural———”<br>
 		that the “sound isn’t actually a lobster’s scream, but the whistle of<br>
hot-air-escaping-the-exoskeleton————”<br>
<br>
Why tell us that lobsters lack vocal chords?<br>
<br>
I don’t really want to know the magician’s tricks<br>
We are here because we want to, even if temporarily,&emsp;&emsp; 		believe!<br>
<br>
feel.<br>
<br>
	And the director, through careful analysis and staging, has presented the story<br>
   in a tightly-wrapped package, has done all the interpretative work already<br>
<br>
	Instead a director might trust in uncertainty, in ambiguity—allowing audiences<br>
   the chance for discovery<br>
<br>
yes, encouraging active engagement<br>
<br>
And if Jesus hadn’t spoken in metaphor? &emsp;	what then?<br>
<br>
Is not the space for renewed interpretation that which grants the Bible, al Qur’an, and the<br>
 “Dramatic Canon” resistance against obsolescence?<br>
<br>
Might we follow Parks’ lead? understand the power we hold as director, as writer, as performer,<br>
and perhaps soften our voices, so that our collaborators, our audiences may speak, too?<br>
<br>
	 Eighteen months ago, if you had asked, I would say: I don’t get poetry<br>
I hadn’t realized that poetry asks a reader to bring parts of herself into the story being told<br>
<br>
 Max Picard writes, “The great poet does not completely fill out the space of his theme<br>
  with his words. He leaves a space clear, into which another and higher poet can speak.<br>
   He allows another to take part in the subject; he makes the subject his own but does<br>
   not keep it entirely for himself” (Picard, World of Silence)<br>

Together, in the darkened seating of our sometime theatre, now our sky<br>
above the ghostlights,&emsp;&emsp;		reading the constellations,<br>
my feelings of awe towards the stars, in large part, derive from:<br>
the remarkable distance of nothingness<br>
light has endured to meet us here.<br>
