                    ABOUT THE PLAY
                    <br>
                    The tragicomic end to an adulterous relationship between Gabe and Zoe, a couple who can say anything to each other, except each other's names.

                    Performed in a 98-sq-ft bedroom, for an invited audience of five, <i>Petnames</i> is an exploration in honesty and intimacy.
                    <br><br>
                    Duration: 45 minutes.
                    <br>
                    Premieres: Spring, 2026, Ridgewood, NYC.

She is especially passionate about new work development and physical theater, with a focus on making art more accessible to contemporary audiences. Recent highlights include leading Leonor Estrada’s new adaptation of <i>The Taming of the Shrew</i>, an outdoor, site-specific production of <i>The Comedy of Errors</i> at Pier 40 on the Hudson River, premiering <i>Moon Walk</i> at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, and playing ‘Scary Girl’ on Hulu’s Castle Rock.

                    <a href="https://www.jacksonkienitz.com" target="_blank">Jackson Kienitz</a> is an actor and writer, with a background in new work for theatre and independent film. Recently, Jackson played a leading role in two feature films: Danny in <i>Sinkholes</i>, a surrealist apocalypse film directed by Graham Cooper, and Freddy Farner in <i>Humbly Yours, Hassock</i>, an indie comedy directed by Tanna Herr. Recent stage credits include Everyman in <i>The Summoning of Everyman</i> at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, and originating the role of B.J. in <i>Bard Overboard</i> at the SoHo Playhouse in New York. He’s written and performed in multiple short-films, including <i>When We’re Back,</i> a film constructed through long-form improvisation. As author, his next play, <i>HONEYDEW NO.2</i>, will debut Summer, 2026. He holds a BA in Creative Writing and Drama from Columbia University, and an MFA in Acting from the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland. Now a tra-la-la, and a step-ball-change. Then a modest curtsy.
