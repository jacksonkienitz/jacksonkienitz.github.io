                    ABOUT THE PLAY
                    <br>
                    The tragicomic end to an adulterous relationship between Gabe and Zoe, a couple who can say anything to each other, except each other's names.
                    <br><br>
                    Performed in a 98-sq-ft bedroom, for an invited audience of five, <i>Petnames</i> is an exploration in honesty and intimacy.
                    <br><br>
                    Duration: 45 minutes.
                    <br>
                    Premieres: March 4th, 2025, Queens, NY.

                    <a href="https://www.karinhoelzl.com" target="_blank">Karin Hoelzl</a> is an actor/writer/producer originally from Virginia. Her theater journey started in her grandparents’ barn, performing musicals with handmade costumes—the rest has been icing. Karin is especially passionate about new work development and physical theater, with a focus on making art more accessible to contemporary audiences. Recent highlights include leading Leonor Estrada’s new adaptation of The Taming of the Shrew, producing and co-starring in HONEYDEW NO. 2 at the Centre for Contemporary Arts in Glasgow, and playing ‘Scary Girl’ on Hulu’s Castle Rock. Karin is currently playing Luciana in The Comedy of Errors, produced by Stairwell Theater on a loading dock in NYC.

                    <a href="https://www.jacksonkienitz.com" target="_blank">Jackson Kienitz</a> is an actor and writer, with a background in new work for theatre and independent film. Recently, Jackson played Everyman in The Summoning of Everyman at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, and originated the role of B.J. in Bard Overboard at the SoHo Playhouse in New York. He’s written and performed in multiple short-films, including The Speech Writer, a solo-performance film, and When We’re Back, a film constructed through long-form improvisation. He’s currently playing the leading role Danny in Sinkholes, a surrealist apocalypse film directed by Graham Cooper. As author, his next play, Petnames, will debut February, 2025, for audiences of five in a 98-ft2 bedroom. He holds a BA in Creative Writing and Drama from Columbia University, and an MFA in Acting from the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland. Now a tra-la-la, and a step-ball-change. Then a modest curtsy.
